Lending Loop

### When was the company incorporated?
2014

### Who are the founders of the company?
Brandon Vlaar, Cato Pastoll (CEO)

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
By identifying inefficiencies surrounding bank lending processes in Canada. Notably, that individuals and businesses are being excluded from the lending process, leaving a significant amount of capital off the table. Lending Loop was the first company in Canada to support P2P lending in Canada.


### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Lending Loop have received US$40 million in funding.

## Business Activities

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The issue of individuals being excluded from the lending market, meaning small businesses have limited access to loans from potential investors who may be less risk-averse than banks.


### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Lending Loop’s two primary customer groups include:
1.	Lenders / Investors (Individuals or businesses)
2.	Borrowers (Businesses)

In 2021, the alternative finance category as a whole forecasts 4.1K loans (+0.8% YOY). Worth US$73.7million industry (+5.7% YOY). For Crowdlending to businesses, 1,100 loans (-2.3% YOY) worth US$47.9 million (+4.1% YOY) are forecast.

According to Statista, the CAGR 2021-25 of crowdlending to businesses is forecast to grow at 2.0% p/a until 2025.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

For one, trust. Lending Loop has a first mover advantage, in that it is Canada’s first approved online P2P lending platform.

Two, control, transparency and flexibility. Lenders can literally tailor their own risk profile and investment appetite, then have it matched to borrowers based on those preferences. 

Three, cost savings. Less reliance on intermediaries charging their own markups and fees.

Fourth, there are few competitors in this space offering a similar product. Lending Loop worked alongside Canada’s regulatory bodies to overcome key hurdles and challenges for P2P lending. There are still major hurdles in place.

Fifth, specialisation. Lending Loop specialises in loans to small businesses. Newer competitors on the market such as GoPeer are focusing on P2P lending to individuals. Comparatively, bigger players in this space (such as Borowell) tend to draw funds from institutional investors.

* Cheaper. You can begin lending as little as CA$200. You can also join free of cost.
* More inclusive. Although Lending Loop enforce certain eligibility requirements for businesses seeking loans, anyone is able to lend money. They also have control over their risk profile, with risk-seeking investors standing to gain as much as 26% for riskier loans.
* More competitive. As an entirely online business, Lending Loop pay little in terms of overheads. These are savings which can then be passed onto the customer.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
* Based on the success of ratesetter (Plenti), enable lenders to set their own desired rates of return, rather than selecting only the risk profiles of the companies they’re lending to. 
* Add additional criteria for businesses to confirm / deny how ethical they are. Allow investors to allocate their money based on their beliefs and views.
* Allow individuals to apply for loans.


### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* For idea one above, the free market should be able to determine which rates to lock in. In a global downturn, 2 people with similar risk profiles should be able to set different rates of return for the same given level of risk. Having a system built solely off credit ratings preferences will by default give these two people the same risk profile. This isn’t as efficient as it could be.
* This idea is based off my own beliefs. I like Raiz purely because it offers an ethical investment portfolio. I don’t even consider the unethical portfolios. I know I’m not an outlier. Many of my friends take the same attitude, and I’d be astounded if young investors didn’t feel the same way in Canada. I want my money helping the world, not hurting it.
* This is an area Lending Loop is already losing ground to GoPeer in. If I had the choice between lending money to an A-rated individual vs a B-rated company, I’d prefer to lend it to the individual.


### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* AI (Machine Learning) for determining credit scores.
* Robo Advisory technologies
* Regtech

Other Idea (not relevant to above question), but they could also consider building the back end on blockchain to enhance security and establish a trustless system.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
