## Business Activities

The issue of individuals being excluded from the lending market, meaning small businesses have limited access to loans from potential investors who may be less risk-averse than banks.


### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Lending Loop’s two primary customer groups include:
1.	Lenders / Investors (Individuals or businesses)
2.	Borrowers (Businesses)


In 2021, the alternative finance category as a whole forecasts 4.1K loans (+0.8% YOY). Worth US$73.7million industry (+5.7% YOY). For Crowdlending to businesses, 1,100 loans (-2.3% YOY) worth US$47.9 million (+4.1% YOY) are forecast.

According to Statista, the CAGR 2021-25 of crowdlending to businesses is forecast to grow at 2.0% p/a until 2025.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

For one, trust. Lending Loop has a first mover advantage, in that it is Canada’s first approved online P2P lending platform.

Two, control, transparency and flexibility. Lenders can literally tailor their own risk profile and investment appetite, then have it matched to borrowers based on those preferences. 

Three, cost savings. Less reliance on intermediaries charging their own markups and fees.

Fourth, there are few competitors in this space offering a similar product. Lending Loop worked alongside Canada’s regulatory bodies to overcome key hurdles and challenges for P2P lending. There are still major hurdles in place.

Fifth, specialisation. Lending Loop specialises in loans to small businesses. Newer competitors on the market such as GoPeer are focusing on P2P lending to individuals. Comparatively, bigger players in this space (such as Borowell) tend to draw funds from institutional investors.
